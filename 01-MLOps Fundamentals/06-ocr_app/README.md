# How-to Guide

In this example, you will get used to a lot of techniques, from training a model
(Text Detection) to implement an ML service with cache, preloaded model, along with callback and websocket architectural styles.

## Training CRAFT

In this section, you will train a text detection model, which will be used further as a component in EasyOCR, which is an end-to-end OCR pipeline.

The dataset used for training was taken from [this](https://github.com/manhph2211/BKAI-Challenge-Vietnamese-OCR/tree/main#chu%E1%BA%A9n-b%E1%BB%8B-d%E1%BB%AF-li%E1%BB%87u) awesome github repository.

To start training, you will run the following commands:

```shell
cd craft
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py --yaml=custom_data_train
```

After training, you should see some `*.pth` files in the folder `craft/exp/custom_data_train`, for example: `CRAFT_clr_amp_4.pth`. Now, move one of them to `my_model`, and rename is to `craft_mlt_25k.pth`.

**Note:**

- Remember to install all the necessary libraries before training.
- This code requires GPU for training, you can make use of https://colab.google/ for this.

## Serving models

Start your server as usual by running the following commands:

```shell
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081
```

or these commands for preloaded model

```shell
uvicorn main_preloaded:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8081
```
